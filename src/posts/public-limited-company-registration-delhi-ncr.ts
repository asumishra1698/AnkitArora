## Introduction

A **Public Limited Company (PLC)** is the preferred structure for businesses that plan to scale with larger capital, institutional investors, or potential stock market listing. While it offers credibility and access to funding, it also comes with strict compliance and governance requirements. If you are planning a **public limited company registration in Delhi NCR**, explore our [public limited company registration service](/start-business/public-limited-company-registration) and use this guide to understand the eligibility rules, documents, capital structure, and post-incorporation obligations.

Many promoters start with a [private limited company](/start-business/private-limited-company-registration) and convert later, but in some cases forming a public company at the outset makes sense. This is especially true for infrastructure projects, large-scale manufacturing, financial services, or ventures that plan to raise public funds. The key is preparation. Public companies have more reporting requirements, more board formalities, and a higher standard of governance. If you set up the structure correctly, you can avoid delays and reduce regulatory risk from day one.

## What Is a Public Limited Company?

A public limited company is a corporate entity registered under the **Companies Act**, with a separate legal identity. It can raise funds from the public by issuing shares, and its shares are freely transferable. A public company can be listed or unlisted. Even unlisted public companies must meet the statutory requirements for public companies, such as minimum directors, shareholder count, and increased disclosure.

Key features include:

- Separate legal entity and perpetual succession.
- Limited liability for shareholders.
- Ability to raise capital from the public and institutional investors.
- More stringent compliance and governance requirements.

In Delhi NCR, public companies are common for large projects, joint ventures, and businesses with long-term expansion plans.

## Who Should Choose This Structure?

A public limited company is suitable if:

- You plan to raise capital from a large number of investors.
- You want the option of stock exchange listing in the future.
- You require a strong, credible corporate structure for large contracts.
- Your business has a high compliance tolerance and can maintain board governance.

If you are early-stage or have a small team, a [private limited company](/start-business/private-limited-company-registration) or [LLP](/start-business/llp-registration) is usually more efficient. But if the scale, funding strategy, or regulatory environment demands a public company, it is better to incorporate correctly from the start.

## Minimum Requirements for Public Limited Company Registration

To register a public limited company in Delhi NCR, you need to meet the statutory minimums under the **Companies Act**:

- **Minimum 3 directors.**
- **Minimum 7 shareholders.**
- **At least one director must be a resident of India.**
- Director Identification Number (DIN) for all directors.
- Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) for all directors.
- Registered office address in Delhi NCR with valid proof.

There is no minimum paid-up capital requirement under current rules, but the authorized capital should be reasonable and aligned with your funding plan.

## Key Advantages of a Public Limited Company

A public limited company offers several strategic advantages:

- Access to larger pools of capital.
- Stronger credibility with lenders, government agencies, and corporate clients.
- Easier transfer of shares and ownership.
- Long-term continuity beyond promoters.

However, these benefits come with higher governance responsibility, which is why planning is essential.

## Step-by-Step Public Limited Company Registration Process

The incorporation process follows **MCA** guidelines. Here is a structured view of the steps:

1) Obtain Digital Signature Certificates (DSC)
All proposed directors need a DSC for digital filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

2) Apply for Director Identification Number (DIN)
DIN is mandatory for all directors. It is applied for during incorporation via **SPICe+** forms.

3) Name approval
You need to apply for a unique name that complies with MCA guidelines and avoids conflicts with existing companies or trademarks.

4) Draft constitutional documents
Prepare the Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Articles of Association (AOA) tailored to a public company. These documents define the objectives, capital structure, and internal rules.

5) File incorporation forms
Submit SPICe+ Part B and linked forms for PAN, TAN, EPFO, ESIC, and bank account if required. After verification, the Certificate of Incorporation is issued.

6) Post-incorporation setup
Open a current account, appoint auditors, issue share certificates, and complete statutory registers.

Our team handles the end-to-end process with compliance checks at every stage to prevent rejection or rework.

## Documents Required

Public limited company registration needs a precise set of documents. The typical list includes:

- PAN and Aadhaar of all directors and shareholders
- Passport for foreign nationals, if any
- Address proof for directors (bank statement or utility bill)
- Registered office proof (rent agreement or ownership documents)
- NOC from the owner for rented premises
- Utility bill for registered office (not older than 2 months)
- Passport-size photographs

Accuracy is critical. Even small mismatches in spelling or address details can delay approval.

## Capital Structure and Shareholding

Public companies can issue shares to the public and have more flexible capital-raising options. You will need to define the authorized capital and initial shareholding at incorporation. Later, you can increase authorized capital with board and shareholder approvals.

Key points to plan:

- Initial paid-up capital and share distribution.
- Classes of shares, if any.
- Future capital raising or listing plans.

If you are not ready to issue shares broadly yet, you can remain an unlisted public company while keeping future listing open.

## Governance and Compliance Requirements

Public companies are subject to stricter governance. Some key compliance obligations include:

- Appointment of statutory auditor within 30 days of incorporation.
- Board meetings at prescribed intervals.
- Annual General Meeting (AGM) every year.
- **Annual filing of financial statements and annual return.**
- Maintenance of statutory registers and minutes.
- Disclosure of director interests and related party transactions.

If you plan to list, additional **SEBI** regulations apply. Even unlisted public companies must follow stricter disclosure and reporting standards compared to private companies. For filings, keep a clear schedule and review [ROC filing requirements](/compliances/roc-filing) to avoid penalties.

## Taxation Overview

A public limited company is taxed under corporate tax rates. It must file annual income tax returns, maintain audited financials, and comply with TDS and GST requirements where applicable. Proper bookkeeping is important because public companies are often scrutinized by investors and lenders.

We recommend setting up robust accounting systems from day one, especially if you plan to raise funds or enter into large contracts.

## Conversion from Private to Public

If you are already running a [private limited company](/start-business/private-limited-company-registration), you can convert it into a public company once you meet the minimum requirements for directors and shareholders. The conversion involves:

- Board and shareholder approvals.
- Alteration of MOA and AOA.
- Filing conversion forms with MCA.
- Updating company name and statutory records.

This is a common approach for businesses that grow into the public structure. We can evaluate whether conversion or fresh incorporation is more efficient based on your current entity and funding plans.

## Timelines and Fees

In Delhi NCR, public limited company registration typically takes 10 to 20 working days, depending on documentation readiness and name approval. The government fees depend on authorized capital and stamp duty, which varies by state. Professional fees depend on complexity and the number of stakeholders involved.

We provide a clear, itemized quote and a realistic timeline before starting the process.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Public company incorporation can be delayed by avoidable errors. Here are common mistakes:

- Choosing a name that conflicts with existing companies or trademarks.
- Incorrect address proof or outdated utility bills.
- Not aligning MOA objects with the actual business activity.
- Missing shareholder approvals and board resolutions.
- Underestimating post-incorporation compliance.

Planning early and using a professional checklist prevents delays and ensures smoother approvals.

## How to Prepare for Funding and Listing

If your long-term goal is to list or raise large funds, set up your company with that roadmap in mind. Consider:

- Clean cap table structure and clear shareholder agreements.
- Strong internal controls and audit-ready records.
- Compliance calendar for board and shareholder meetings.
- Transparent reporting and MIS systems.

These steps help you build investor confidence and reduce friction later in the lifecycle.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a minimum capital requirement for a public company?

No law sets a minimum paid-up capital today, but you should choose authorized capital that matches your funding plan, contracts, and expected scale. Too low can create extra filings when you raise funds; too high can increase stamp duty and fees. We recommend mapping near-term funding needs and setting capital that supports them without unnecessary cost.

### Can a public company be unlisted?

Yes. A public company can remain unlisted indefinitely and still operate under Companies Act rules. Listing is optional and depends on your growth strategy, profitability, governance, and readiness for SEBI compliance. Many promoters choose to stay unlisted while building scale and investor confidence, then list later when funding needs and market conditions align for a public issue.

### How many directors are required?

A minimum of three directors is required, and at least one must be resident in India. Directors must hold valid DINs and DSCs for filings. For governance, it is common to appoint a mix of executive and non-executive directors, and to set up clear board meeting and disclosure practices early to avoid compliance gaps.

### Can a foreign national be a director or shareholder?

Yes, foreign nationals can be directors or shareholders, but you must provide passport, overseas address proof, and compliant KYC documentation. If a foreign director is appointed, the company must still have at least one resident director in India. FEMA and RBI rules may apply to share subscriptions or investment, so we recommend structuring the cap table and filings carefully from the start.

### Is public company registration right for small startups?

Usually no. Most early-stage startups benefit from private limited structures because compliance is lighter and governance requirements are simpler. A public company makes sense when you need wider capital access, are preparing for a public issue, or operate in sectors that require stronger disclosure and oversight. If you are unsure, we can evaluate your funding roadmap and scale to decide the best fit.

## Final Thoughts

Public limited company registration in Delhi NCR is a serious step that brings strong credibility and access to capital, but also higher compliance requirements. If your business needs a structure built for scale, this can be the right choice. The key is to plan the capital structure, governance, and compliance roadmap carefully from day one.
