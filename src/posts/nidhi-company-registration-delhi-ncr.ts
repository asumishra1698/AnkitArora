## Introduction

A **Nidhi Company** is a unique type of non-banking finance company created to encourage thrift and savings among members. It can accept deposits and lend only to its members, which makes the structure ideal for community-based lending and savings groups. If you are planning **Nidhi company registration in Delhi NCR**, this guide from Arora Ankit and Associates walks you through eligibility, capital requirements, member rules, and compliance so you can incorporate correctly and avoid regulatory delays.

Nidhi companies are governed by the Companies Act and the **Nidhi Rules, 2014**. While the structure is simpler than most NBFCs, it still has strict rules on membership, deposits, and lending. A clear compliance roadmap is essential because non-compliance can attract penalties or restrictions on operations. Use this guide as a practical checklist and learn when it makes sense to choose a Nidhi company over a [private limited company](/start-business/private-limited-company-registration) or [LLP](/start-business/llp-registration).

## What Is a Nidhi Company?

A Nidhi company is a public company formed with the objective of cultivating savings among its members and providing loans to those members. It is not allowed to deal with outsiders, which keeps the risk localized and member-focused. It is registered with the **MCA** and regulated primarily under the Companies Act and Nidhi Rules, rather than direct RBI licensing.

Key features include:

- It must be a **public limited company** with at least seven members and three directors.
- It can accept deposits and lend only to its members.
- It cannot issue preference shares or conduct hire-purchase or leasing.
- It must comply with specific member, deposit, and fund ratio rules.

## Who Should Consider a Nidhi Company?

A Nidhi company is suitable when:

- You want a member-based savings and lending model.
- The business will operate within a defined community or group.
- You want a regulated structure without full NBFC licensing.
- You have a plan to reach the membership and capital thresholds within time.

If you are planning to lend to the general public or raise funds from external investors, a Nidhi company is not the right fit. In such cases, a different structure or a regulated NBFC is more appropriate.

## Minimum Requirements for Nidhi Company Registration

To register a Nidhi company in Delhi NCR, you must meet these minimums at incorporation:

- Minimum **7 members** and **3 directors**.
- At least one director must be a resident of India.
- A registered office address in Delhi NCR with valid proof.
- Authorized and paid-up capital aligned with Nidhi rules.
- Name must end with **"Nidhi Limited"**.

After incorporation, the company must reach **200 members**, net owned funds of **Rs. 10 lakh**, and a **1:20** ratio of net owned funds to deposits within prescribed timelines.

## Step-by-Step Nidhi Company Registration Process

The incorporation process follows MCA requirements with additional Nidhi-specific conditions:

1) Obtain **Digital Signature Certificates (DSC)**
All directors require DSCs for online filings.

2) Apply for **Director Identification Number (DIN)**
DIN is mandatory for all directors and is applied through SPICe+ forms.

3) Name approval
Choose a unique name that ends with "Nidhi Limited" and complies with MCA guidelines.

4) Draft MOA and AOA
The **MOA** must clearly state the Nidhi objectives, and the **AOA** should include membership and deposit rules.

5) File incorporation forms
Submit SPICe+ Part B and linked forms for PAN, TAN, and bank account setup. On approval, you receive the Certificate of Incorporation.

6) Post-incorporation actions
Open a current account, issue share certificates, appoint auditors, and maintain statutory registers.

We can handle the entire flow and ensure Nidhi-specific clauses are correctly included.

## Documents Required

Nidhi company registration requires a precise document set:

- PAN and Aadhaar of all directors and shareholders
- Passport for foreign nationals, if any
- Address proof for directors
- Registered office proof and utility bill
- NOC from the owner for rented premises
- Passport-size photographs

Correct documentation avoids resubmissions and speeds up approval.

## Capital and Membership Requirements

Nidhi companies must maintain **net owned funds** and member thresholds to operate without restrictions. Key rules include:

- Minimum paid-up equity capital as per Nidhi Rules.
- Net owned funds of **Rs. 10 lakh** within a year of incorporation.
- At least **200 members** within a year.
- Net owned funds to deposits ratio of **1:20**.

These thresholds are critical. If you miss them, your company may face restrictions on accepting deposits or making new loans.

## Deposits and Lending Rules

A Nidhi company can accept deposits and lend only to members. Some key restrictions include:

- It cannot accept deposits from outsiders.
- Loans must be secured and comply with limits specified in Nidhi Rules.
- Interest rates and tenure must follow regulated caps.

Maintaining accurate member records and loan registers is essential for compliance and audit readiness.

## Governance and Compliance

Nidhi companies follow public company compliance requirements, with added Nidhi obligations. These include:

- Board meetings and annual general meeting.
- Statutory audit and annual filings.
- Maintenance of member registers and deposit records.
- Periodic reporting to the MCA.

Use a structured compliance calendar and review [ROC filing requirements](/compliances/roc-filing) to avoid penalties.

## Taxation Overview

Nidhi companies are taxed as regular companies under corporate tax rates. They must file annual income tax returns, comply with **TDS**, and register for **GST** if applicable. If the company provides services that fall under GST thresholds, complete [GST registration](/licenses/gst-registration) on time.

A clean accounting system and compliant bookkeeping are essential for credibility with members and regulators.

## Timelines and Costs

Nidhi company registration in Delhi NCR typically takes **10 to 20 working days**, depending on name approval and documentation readiness. Government fees depend on authorized capital and state stamp duty. Professional fees vary by complexity and number of stakeholders.

We provide a transparent quote and timeline before starting the process.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Avoid these issues that frequently delay approvals:

- Choosing a name without the required "Nidhi Limited" suffix.
- Submitting outdated or inconsistent address proofs.
- Failing to align MOA objects with Nidhi activities.
- Ignoring membership and net owned funds thresholds.
- Missing statutory registers and board documentation.

A checklist-driven approach prevents compliance gaps from day one.

## Nidhi vs Other Business Structures

If you are comparing options, consider these points:

- A **Nidhi company** works only with members and focuses on savings and lending.
- A [private limited company](/start-business/private-limited-company-registration) offers broader commercial activity and fundraising.
- An [LLP](/start-business/llp-registration) is simpler for professional services but cannot accept public deposits.
- A [producer company](/start-business/producer-company-registration) is designed for farmer and producer collectives, not lending.

Choosing the right structure depends on your business purpose and compliance capacity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is RBI approval required for Nidhi company registration?

No. Nidhi companies are governed by the Companies Act and the Nidhi Rules, 2014, and they do not require separate RBI licensing at incorporation. However, they must comply with strict membership, deposit, and lending rules. If the company deviates from Nidhi objectives or accepts deposits from non-members, it can face regulatory action, so compliance discipline is essential from the start.

### What is the minimum capital required for a Nidhi company?

There is no fixed statutory minimum paid-up capital today, but you must reach net owned funds of **Rs. 10 lakh** within one year of incorporation. You should plan authorized and paid-up capital that aligns with your membership and deposit targets. Under-capitalization can lead to restrictions on deposits, while over-capitalization can raise stamp duty and compliance costs.

### How many members are required after incorporation?

A Nidhi company must have at least **200 members** within one year from incorporation. If the company fails to reach this number, it may be restricted from accepting fresh deposits or making new loans until it complies. You should build a membership acquisition plan early, and maintain accurate records to demonstrate compliance during audits and MCA reviews.

### Can a Nidhi company lend to non-members?

No. A Nidhi company can lend only to its members, and loans must be secured in accordance with Nidhi Rules. Lending to outsiders is a compliance violation and can attract penalties or restrictions. The company must maintain member registers, loan agreements, and security documentation so that every loan can be traced back to a valid member relationship.

### What are the ongoing compliance requirements for a Nidhi company?

Nidhi companies must follow public company compliance plus Nidhi-specific rules. This includes board meetings, annual general meetings, statutory audits, and annual ROC filings, along with maintaining member, deposit, and loan registers. The company must also meet the net owned funds and deposit ratio requirements. A compliance calendar and periodic reviews help avoid penalties and operational restrictions.

## Final Thoughts

Nidhi company registration in Delhi NCR is a strong option for member-based savings and lending organizations, but it requires disciplined compliance and clear operational planning. If you meet the membership and capital requirements and follow the Nidhi Rules closely, you can build a trusted community finance institution with a stable foundation.
